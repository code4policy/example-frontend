# example-frontend

This is the "single-page style" project. See the multi-page style project (bottom of this README) for a more simple setup if you're having trouble. Selecting the multi-page setup (which will put only one chart on each page) will help you avoid conflicting CSS and JS across charts.

It is published on the master branch here: https://dmil.github.io/example-frontend/
